Themes
======

Bigglesworth provides 3 basic themes, that (at least, right now) apply to the Editor window.
Dark and Light themes are very similar, but can have some issues in particular systems.
The "system" theme is completely based on your computer's color palette and fonts.

Customization
..............

If you encounter any visualization issue (low contrast, small fonts) you can try another
theme, but is also possible to create custom themes derived from the existing ones.

Just press the "Theme editor..." to see the editor dialog, select a theme to start from,
and press "Copy".

Once editing is completed, save it, close the theme editor dialog and select it: 
Bigglesworth's Editor window will automatically update its appearance accordingly.
