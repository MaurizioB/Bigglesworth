Dump
====

Unfortunately, it is impossible to know the actual contents of the wavetables that have already
been dumped to the Blofeld, as Waldorf never disclosed how or if it is actually possible to achieve
such possibility.

This means that once a wavetable is dumped, it cannot be "dumped back" from the Blofeld, thus
it is not possible to know actual names and contents of the 39 slots the Blofeld offers.

Keep this in mind, as once you dump a wavetable there is no way to restore it if you did not
save it locally in Blofeld's database.

Since you might have previously dumped wavetables on your Blofeld, you probably don't want 
to overwrite them. To ensure that, open the "Blofeld" panel in Wavetable library, right click 
on the wavetable slot you don't want to overwrite and check "Set as read only".
