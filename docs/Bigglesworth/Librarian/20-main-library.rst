The Main Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Main Library is a special kind of collection, as it contains all the sounds in the database (then it
does not have the 1024 sounds limit) and cannot be reordered.

The best way to access it is through the Side library panel (from the Library menu).

The sidebar contains a tree view categorized by collections, categories and tags.
Clicking on any of the subsections filters the contents on the right of the sidebar, 
and multiple filters can be selected by keeping SHIFT pressed while clicking on an item.

Additionally, it is possible to do a text search by name, which will furtherly filter 
the results.

All sounds are sorted by insertion order, starting from the Waldorf presets. 

As per every collection, you can click on the header of the table to sort them by name, 
category or tag_. Please note that sorting through the full library consumes a lot of
processing.

The Main Library is also accessible as a "Collection view", similarly to other collections.
To open it, right click on one of the top tab of the Librarian and select it from the sub-menu
"Open collection" (the same you can see in the "Library" menu of the Librarian window).

In collection view mode, "Name" and "Tags" edit fields can be used to filter the results, 
while the "Include" combo box allows you to filter in/out presets, custom made sounds, and 
sounds that are not stored in any collection_.

Remember that preset sounds are read-only, and, while tags can be applied to them, they cannot be 
edited, deleted nor renamed. Those sounds are usually styled in *italic*.

From the Main Library you can add a sound to a collection_ by dragging it to the slot you want. 
To overwrite an existing slot in a collection, keep CTRL pressed while dropping.
