Introduction
==============

The Sound Editor is possibly the main core of Bigglesworth.

Its interface tries to respect the workflow of the Blofeld's DSP as much as 
possible, but, for obvious reasons, it's not perfect.

Controls are organized by family, almost as they are grouped in the Blofeld 
"menus". We could divide everything in 5 main sections.

On the top we have:

- General controls

  - Mixer
  - Amplifier
  - Glide
  - Common

- `Display`_

- Sound generators

  - Oscillators
  - Low Frequency Oscillators (LFOs)

- Filters

And, on the bottom:

- Envelopes
- Effects
- `Arpeggiator`_
- Virtual keyboard
