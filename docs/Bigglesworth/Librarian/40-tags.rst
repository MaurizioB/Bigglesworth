.. _what:

:subsection:`Why tags?`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While Blofeld's Categories can be useful, they can be a limitation.

Tags have no such limits, as you can assign more than one to each sound, so that you can have a
sound tagged as "Strings", "Pad" and "Dark".

In addition to this, tags can be colored using both background and foreground (text) colors,
to better identify them in your collections.

Remember that tags are a feature specific to Bigglesworth, you will never see them in your Blofeld
and will be ignored when exporting to a `SysEx`_ file.

.. _manage:

:subsection:`Create and manage tags`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tags can be managed from |tagIcon| "Edit tags" in "Library" menu of the Librarian.

From this dialog, you can create, rename or delete any tag, and it is also possible to set its
background and foreground color.

|Note| Suggestion: try to avoid very long tags, they could become invisible if multiple tags
are applied to a sound; also, do not use very similar names, or select different colors to better 
identify them.

.. _apply:

:subsection:`Edit sounds tags`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tags can be applied to sounds by right clicking on them and selecting |tagIcon| "Edit tags...".
Multiple sounds can be selected to set the same tags to all of them.

The appearing dialog window will show the current tags for the selected sounds (if any) and
a list of all available tags. They can be added by selecting them from the list or by typing the 
tag name in the tag field. The keyboard allows to add and remove existing tags using Backspace or Delete.

The dialog also allows to edit tags (and add new ones) from the "Manage tags" button.
