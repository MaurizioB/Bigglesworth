Factory Presets
===============

Bigglesworth includes the 3 standard factory preset sound sets provided by Waldorf.

These are three special kinds of collections, as they are not editable, nor deletable,
and their sounds are read-only. If you open a factory preset sound and edit it, you 
will have to save it as a new sound.

Factory preset 1: January 2008
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the sound set that was included when the Blofeld was released in 2008. 
The H Bank contains only drums and percussive sounds.
This preset is included primarly for historical and testing purposes, as most of 
its sounds have inconsistent volume values.

Factory preset 2: February 2008
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This sound set was released after some complaints about the forementioned volume 
issues, and its sounds are much more balanced than the first version.

597 sounds in total have been changed, having a different Amplifier Volume value, 
and other parameters slightly modified, as some values were off range or had issues
while playing.

Factory preset 3: 2012
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is an almost completely new sound set released for new units shipped after 2012.

The H Bank sounds are identical, and only some parameters have been slightly updated.
