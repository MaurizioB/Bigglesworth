:subsection:`Main tabs`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Librarian uses a two-sided visualization that can be useful to organize your sounds.
Each side or panel shows at least one view of a collection_ (or the `Main Library`_), but it is always
possible to have more "tabs" on each side.

Views can be re-ordered within the same side by dragging it with the mouse, and can be moved to
the opposite side by right clicking on its tab and selecting the relative option from the menu. From the
same menu it is also possible to switch the contents of each panel to the opposite side.

.. _basic:

:subsection:`Basic operations`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To edit a sound it is enough to double click it, and the Editor Window will automatically open with
its parameters. If your Blofeld is also connected, it will receive the relative "`Program Change`_".

Most basic operations on sounds can be achieved by right clicking on it:

- "Open in the Sound Editor": the same as double clicking on the item
- "Dump": send the sound to the Blofeld or request a sound from it (see `Dumping`_)
- "Find duplicate": show the "Find duplicate" dialog window, that will search the whole database,
  looking for identical sounds (see `Duplicate sounds`_)
- "Export": save the sound in `SysEx`_ format.

Note that, depending on the current view (a collection_, a preset_ or the `Main Library`_), 
specific items will appear. See the relative sections to learn more.
