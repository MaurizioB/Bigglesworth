=======

The main display is very much similar to the one the Blofeld has, but provides
some more informations.

You can change the sound name by clicking on it.
Remember that a sound name can only have up to 16 characters, and only a limited
set of characters can be used, which does not include any accented letter or 
non-latin characters.

On the top left corner, the collection of the current sound is shown.
If the current sound is used in more than one collection, the text "various"
might appear.

On the bottom of the collection text, the current Bank and Program number is shown,
if the current sound appears at least in one collection and it was opened from 
that collection.

If you need to notify the Blofeld about the current bank and program (for 
example, you connected or switched it on after opening the Sound Editor, just
click on the "SEND" button.

On top of the sound name, a small letter could appear: if "E" is shown, it means
that the sound has been modified, but not saved to the database; if an "S" is 
displayed, it means that the sound has been saved.

The current status and last modification is shown at the bottom of the sound 
name; on the right two small buttons will allow you to undo or redo those 
modifications. Keep the left mouse button pressed on those buttons when they 
are enabled to cycle through more than one undo/redo action or show the 
modification history.
