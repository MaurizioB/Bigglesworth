Print sound list
================

Sometimes it is useful to have a list of the sounds in your Blofeld on file or paper.
Bigglesworth allows you to do this, with a nice level of customization.

Right click on the tab of the collection you want to save and select "Save/print sound 
list" from the "Export" submenu.

The list export dialog will show, allowing you various options such as selecting 
the collection to save from, changing the sorting rule sounds will be listed from,
the ordering, and, most importantly, the visualization layout.

Sound lists can be both exported to a simple text file, and printed or saved to a 
PDF file. While the text file options are obviously limited, the print/PDF section 
can be quite advanced. Leaving it to the default parameters will be good enough,
but, by clicking the "Show options", you will have access to much more advanced 
customization, such as font family, size and style, heading (as in "bank") styling,
and so on.

Whatever options you might want to set, what you are left with is just to select
if you want to save to a PDF file or print using one of your installed printers.

Once you are done, just click "Save" (or "Print"), and... voil√†! :-)
