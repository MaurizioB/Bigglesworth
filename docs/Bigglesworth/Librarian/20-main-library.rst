The Main Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Main Library is a special kind of collection, as it contains all the sounds in the database (then it
does not have the 1024 sounds limit) and cannot be reordered.

To access the Main Library, right click on one of the top tab of the Librarian and select it from the sub-menu
"Open collection" (the same you can see in the "Library" menu of the Librarian window).

All sounds are sorted by insertion order, starting from the Waldorf presets. As per every collection, you can
click on the header of the table to sort them by name, category or tag_.

"Name" and "Tags" edit fields can be used to filter the results, while the "Include" combo box allows you to
filter in/out presets, custom made sounds, and sounds that are not stored in any collection_.

Remember that preset sounds are read-only, and, while tags can be applied to them, they cannot be 
edited, deleted nor renamed. Those sounds are usually styled in *italic*.

From the Main Library you can add a sound to a collection_ by dragging it to the slot you want. To overwrite
an existing slot in a collection, keep CTRL pressed while dropping.
