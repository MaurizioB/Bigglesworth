:summary:`The librarian allows you to manage all your sounds`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


We all know the feeling: after hours of playing around, we have found the perfect sound.
But we don't know where to store it. Somehow, 1024 slots, are never enough.

You might have been considerate, clearing uninteresting sounds, after hours of painful search.
But sometimes that's not enough.
Obviously, every basic Blofeld editor can help you with that, but usually they just let you
see what you've got.

Bigglesworth uses an internal database to store all your sounds, the only limit is the free
space on your disk (and the amount of RAM your computer has, ok...).

All sounds are stored in the `Main Library`_ which is organized in custom `collections`_.

The `Main Library`_ also includes the official Waldorf presets, which are 
normally available through their `website <https://waldorfmusic.com>`_.

`Collections`_ are used to group together up to 1024 sounds, exactly like the Blofeld does.

By default, Bigglesworth contains the following 4 collections, which can *not* be deleted:

1. Blofeld Factory Presets (Jan. 2008)
2. Blofeld Factory Presets (Feb. 2008)
3. Blofeld Factory Presets (2012)
4. *Blofeld*

The 3 factory presets are also completely read only.
The "*Blofeld*" collection is usually empty the first time you start Bigglesworth, and can
be used to "mirror" the contents of your beloved synthesizer.
